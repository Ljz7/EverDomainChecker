# Ever Domain Checker v0.1

EverDomainChecker is a PHP script using cURL to check the http status for a
given domain list. 

The script uses (and requires) the RollingCurlX PHP classe shared by [marcushat](https://github.com/marcushat).
You can find the repository here : https://github.com/marcushat/RollingCurlX

We hope you enjoy using this script.
